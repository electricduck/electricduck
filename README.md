## Ducky 🦆

_Command line? Is that some kind of special cable?_

I'm Ducky, or ElectricDuck, an ex-professional developer (of 5-ish years since the age of 17) turned hobbyiest developer, hailing from the Northern part of the 🇬🇧 United Kingdom. I do normal boring shit during the day and work on OSS projects during my spare time. Most of my GitHub is a barren wasteland of failed attempts but more recent projects are genuinely interesting, so take a peek 👀.

And no, **I am not looking for work**. Stop sending me emails for the love of god.
